Thanks for checking out my game!

=-= Gameplay -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a simulation game in which you take care of Kasane Teto.
The goal of the game is to keep Teto alive as long as possible.

=-= Current phase =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The game is not complete yet, in fact it's not even close.
Right now, the three main things I expect from you are:
- Findings bugs
- Recommending new ideas
- You having fun
These are 3 main factors that will keep the game alive!

=-= Difficulty -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

You can change the difficulty of the game in the pause menu before starting.
Changing the difficulty will increase/decrease the in-game speed.

=-= Customization =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Game has keybinds and preference settings to make it more handy.
Navigate to "src/settings.js" to view/change the keybinds and settings.
