Local: Code -> download ZIP, extract zip, launch index.html

=-= **Gameplay** -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a simulation game in which you take care of Kasane Teto.

The goal of the game is to keep Teto alive as long as possible.

=-= **Current phase** =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The game is not complete yet, in fact it's not even close.

Right now, the three main things I expect from you are:

- Findings bugs
- Recommending new ideas
- You having fun

These are 3 main factors that will keep the game alive!

=-= **Difficulty** -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

You can change the difficulty of the game in the pause menu before starting.

Changing the difficulty will increase/decrease the in-game speed.

=-= **Customization** =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

If you download the game, you can change the keybinds.

Navigate to "src/settings.js" to view or change the keybinds.
